Whenever a process comes or executes it is assigned a physical or virtual memory.  The process by which the memory is partially or fully reserved for the execution of programs or processes is called memory allocation. Programs and services are assigned with a specific memory as per their requirements when they are executed.  Once the program has finished its operation or is idle, the memory is released and allocated to another program or merged within the primary memory.  We have to make a simulator showing how the memory is allocated to the processes that will be convenient, efficient to use, and easy to understand.
